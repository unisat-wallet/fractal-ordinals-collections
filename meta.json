  "description": "The Blesstiger collection, recognized as the first unique and non-replicable Trident inscription, has attained exclusivity due to its two curses and three consecutive IDs, rendering it no longer producible.Trident inscriptions, bound together in life and death, transfer simultaneously.  This marks the dawn of a new epoch in Trident inscription art. Looking ahead, we foresee the introduction of more blessed, trinumbered Trident inscriptions, drawing a diverse array of artists to this novel art form. Blesstiger stands as the first application of the BGP protocol and notably, the first to highlight limitations in the Ordinals protocol. This initiative transcends a mere NFT innovation; it leads in utilizing Bitcoin as a medium for goods production, advocating for Bitcoin's amalgamation with centralized commerce, all while maintaining decentralization and absolute privacy. Our endeavor embodies the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto.",

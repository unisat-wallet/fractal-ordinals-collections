  "description": "Each Fractal Tree uses a symmetric binary tree equation to generate a tree structure using geometry. The pieces are time-of-day aware, with lighting and colors changing from the day/night cycle. THREE.js and other 3d inscription libraries have been migrated to Fractal to make this possible! ~ Created by MDV (Creator of BTC Substance, Vessels, GenSkullz, & more)",

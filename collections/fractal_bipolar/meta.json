As Fractal evolves to support Scrypt, we'll upgrade our launchpad to a fully smart-contract-driven minting experience. Currently, we're using limited op codes like op_cat to create a secure environment for NFT enthusiasts. With Merkle tree verification, no sniper can steal what's yours. We only wake-up the genius, YOU IN OR OUT?",

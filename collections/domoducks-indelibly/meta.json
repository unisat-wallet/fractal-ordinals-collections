  "description": "DomoDucks Indelibly is the first parent-child provenance collection with multi-layered mechanics. The collection began as a series of 256 Early Stamps (each containing 256 colors and 256,000 pixels) that were inscribed to commemorate the day that Fractal began indexing inscriptions. The first stamp in the collection is Inscription #5050, which is fitting because another set of 256 stamps were inscribed under it and airdropped to each holder so as to split the collection 50/50 between the Early Stamps (~blocks 21,000–22,000) and the Child Stamps. The collection draws inspiration from Andy Warhol’s rubber-stamp prints in the iconic 1967 Pop art book Stamped Indelibly. Only 225 editions of Stamped Indelibly were published, and—in keeping with that historical precedent—256 editions of a physical DomoDucks Indelibly book have also been published. Each book contains 22 signed prints showcasing the 256 Child Stamps. Moreover, holders who use an Early Stamp to claim a physical copy of the book also receive a Book Verification Reinscription on the same satoshi. These special reinscriptions are designated via the ♻️ emoji. Lastly, I developed an algorithmic application that allows holders to recursively reference their Child Stamps into a single Glitch Stamp animation composite that is inscribed below each one as a multi-parent inscription to reward holders at no cost to them via on-chain breeding.

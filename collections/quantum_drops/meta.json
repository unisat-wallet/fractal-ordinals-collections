  "description": "Quantum Drops is inspired by the paradoxical nature of quantum phenomena, exploring both the elusive and immutable aspects of the digital realm. The colors and patterns of each piece are a visual representation of quantum world, where particles exist in a state of flux until observed, only then to become fixed in their form. This duality is reflected in the immutable nature of Quantum Drops on the blockchain. Each Quantum Drop is a uinique high resolution vector image which is programmatically generated based on its inscriprion ID and becomes an immutable digital artifact, much like a quantum particle that, once measured, retains its property. Only 420 Quantum Drops will ever exist.",
